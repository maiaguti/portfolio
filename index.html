                        <h3>Earth Hands Website</h3>
                        <p>This is a single-page website designed and developed for a potter, using semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                            The more technical focus was to implement certain JavaScript functions including light/dark mode, a contact 
                            form that returns the user's responses and/or errors, a number matching game, and a single item display section. 
                            More personally, I wanted the website to be cohesive and personality driven, as seen in the colors of clay and the fonts. </p>

                        <h3>Alive and Wandering Website</h3>
                        <p>This is a vacation rental website designed and developed to showcase rental properties, allow date-searches for booking, and display weather for the cities where the rental properties are located.
                        For the purposes of this project, only the home page was coded, however it has prompts for more pages. The intention was to design a page that felt comfortable and home-y to the site user, while implementing
                        technical features- particularly using JavaScript- including web storage, a jQuery widget, an API, and an image carousel.</p>

                    <h3>Gema Website Redesign</h3>
                    <p>This is a full multipage responsive website re-design including pre- and post-production 
                        processes. The first steps included a project brief, mood board, and clarified branding. 
                        From there, the website pages and a sitemap were sketched out. Then the designs were 
                        prototyped in Figma. The intention of the redesign was to make the website more user-
                        focused, accessible, usable, and professional, thus better reaching and drawing in the 
                        restaurant's intended “audience”.</p>

                        <p>This Pinterest user-interaction re-design prototype was developed through a detailed process, including: 
                            a creative brief with brand adherence details; a user-flow chart; a storyboard for the animation; and the prototype 
                            created in After Effects. The final prototype, as seen above, was rendered as a gif per project guidelines.</p>

                    <p>This is a fully responsive single-page website made for a children's author, which was 
                        created using HTML and CSS to match wireframes that were provided (the text was also provided). 
                        In addition to showing ability with semantic and responsive HTML and CSS, the site features SEO 
                        building through keywords, meta tags, linking, and twitter cards. </p>

                        <h3>Catalyst Creative Brief</h3>
                        <p>This is a creative brief made for a video bumper / stinger commissioned by PBS Arizona's 
                            show Catalyst; a good example of a thorough and organized pre-production process step. 
                            It is two pages long and is intended to outline what is required for the project, to portray 
                            the tone and mission of the project and client, and to share branding guidelines such as fonts and colors. 
                            A creative brief is used as a point of reference while working on a project and can also 
                            be applied as a sort of contract between the designer and the client.</p>

                        <p>Created solely in Adobe Illustrator for a music festival called Endless Summer, this poster 
                            was designed with the intention to promote the festival in a way that arouses nostalgia 
                            for those summer days and nights wherein people make memories that last a lifetime. Designed 
                            for print, the color space used was CMYK, the dimensions are 11x17” and the resolution of 
                            the document is 300ppi. </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there!</p>
            <p>My name's Maia. I'm an artist in many forms of the word: a songwriter, 
                singer, and painter, to name a few; and recently, I've worked 
                to take my passion and creativity further as I focus professionally on what I call "practical art"...
                front-end web design and development, and branding.</p>
            <p>I recently graduated from Arizona State University, where I earned my 
                bachelor's degree in Graphic Information Technology 100% remotely, with honors,
                through their accelerated online program! I'm meticulous, empathetic, and eager to learn and grow through
                the things I don't know (hey, that rhymed!).</p>
            <p>I think outside the box and run with the ideas that evoke emotion. 
                I hope to use design to inspire others and authentically share the unique 
                stories of those who partner with me.</p>
            <p>I'm a passionate soul, plant mama, wellness enthusiast, and wife to a chef, 
                who hails from a buzzing surf town in Southern California. So, if you ever 
                lose me, I'm probably “knee deep in the water somewhere,” soaking in 
                the negative ions, enjoying the salty air and sunshine, sourcing inspiration 
                for my next project.</p>
